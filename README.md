# node-fs-in-memory

This module provides an in-memory implementation of the `fs` module. Functions
and behaviour are added as required, so this is far from being a complete
implementation. Patches and pull requests to add functions and make
behaviour more realistic are very welcome!

## Implemented functions

### fs.readFile

### fs.readdir

### fs.exists

### fs.mkdir

### fs.writeFile
